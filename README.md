Random Maze Generator

- Python code to create a random maze out of a 20x20 grid
- Utilized Python library Pygame for graphical rendering
- Implemented Disjoint Set Union Data structure to keep track of the connectivity of the connected component, by labelling the sets of cells as vertices
- Implemented a Kruskal-like algorithm to build a minimum spanning tree out of the cells, resulting in diverse and challenging mazes


Here are a few mazes obtained using the code:
